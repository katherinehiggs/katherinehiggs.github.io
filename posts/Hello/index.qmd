It’s been a little while since I last updated this blog, despite having an 80% finished post sitting on my computer since November! It has been quite a few months but I’m determined to get back on track. One thing that has changed is that I am now learning Swift with Paul Hudson’s amazing [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui). This came about after repairing my old M1 Macbook Air (quite a scary thing to DIY) and subsequently falling back in love with everything Apple. So as well as posting about data visualition and statistics I would also like to make some posts about iOS development in the future so stay tuned : ).

Enjoy some pictures of my cats (Autumn and Ebony) for reading this far.
